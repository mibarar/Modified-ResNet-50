# Modified-ResNet-50
 A modified version of the classical ResNet-50 architecture is used for image classification

This project was developed for the final exam of my course (Deep Learning - December 2020)[https://softuni.bg/trainings/2781/deep-learning-december-2020], taught at (SoftUni)[https://softuni.bg/] by Yordan Darakchiev.

This was my first Deep Learning project.
